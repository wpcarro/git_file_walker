# Git File Walker

Basic Utility for walking through a file's change history. There are a few 
improvements that the script needs. It is not fully cross-platform at the 
moment. It allows needs a few keybindings to engage with the `less` pager more
interactively. Stay tuned for changes. Submit PRs if you have any enhancements 
in mind. My Python is rudimentary, so open to comments in that regard as well.
